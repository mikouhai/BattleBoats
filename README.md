|- MY REPO CONTAINS THE FINAL COPY OF THE LAB
	|- Summary of the Lab in my Own Words
        |- In Lab9 we made battleboats, where it is a plagurised version of battleship, I did messeage.c and field.c while my partner did agent.c and negotation.c along with test cases for one another. More him and than me as I was unable to finish my test cases.
    |- What was your approach?
        |- My approach to the lab was starting early and failing to complete it regardless, as I strugged to understand how message.c and field.c worked
        |- I was eventually able to pull through thanks to the hints on discord where many people would discuss
        |- the lab in addition to sitting in on LAB sections. I first started with the messagee.c files
	    |- doing the provided functions but ran into issues as I was unable to understand the directions in the 
        |- comments above the functions this brought upon more pain as I wrestled with my code to properly
	    |- compile and hope that it passes my lab partners test cases After some help with peers and TA I finally
	    |- got the make file compiling without errors 
        |- Somethings I messed up on was starting late as I was fighting against time,
    |- Results
        |- In the end I was able to complete the lab, although the field.c does compile with a few issues
        |- display the board wrong.
